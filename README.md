# Hi, I'm Pete 👋

I'm a Brisbane-based technology strategist and builder with a decade working at the intersection of AI, infrastructure, and higher education.

I'm interested in how AI actually gets adopted in organisations - not the demos, but the messy reality of integration, change management, and making it stick.

When I'm not thinking about that, I'm building things to scratch my own itches.

## 🔨 What I'm building

- **[ourgroceries-bridge](https://github.com/PeteInBrissie/ourgroceries-bridge)** — HTTP bridge connecting Claude to OurGroceries shopping lists, with an AI-powered meal planner. Runs self-hosted over Tailscale.
- **[ai-prompts](https://github.com/PeteInBrissie/ai-prompts)** — Collection of prompts I use with Claude.ai projects

## 🛠️ Stack I work with

Node.js / TypeScript · Swift · Docker · PostgreSQL · Tailscale · Home Assistant · Anthropic Claude API
